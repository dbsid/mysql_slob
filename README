WORK_LOOP=0                     -- The max loop iteration
SCALE=10000                     -- The number of rows to be populate when setup the schemas
WORK_UNIT=64                    -- The number of rows to be selected or updated

SHARED_DATA_MODULUS=0           -- If each session do selects/updates on the same schema user1 every n loop iteration
DO_UPDATE_HOTSPOT=FALSE         -- If each session do updates on the same schema user1 every n loop iteration
HOTSPOT_PCT=10                  -- Hotspot data percent

THINK_TM_MODULUS=0              -- Go to sleep every n loop iteration
THINK_TM_MIN=.1                 -- Min sleep time
THINK_TM_MAX=.5                 -- Max sleep time

About Mystat:
-------------
misc/mysql_slob.pl will capture the activity statistics, need to install below perl modules, better by cpan.
